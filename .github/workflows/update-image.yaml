      - main # Or the branch your Argo CD app 'simple-nginx-server' is watching
    # --- NEW: Prevent workflow from triggering on its own commits ---
    paths:
      - '**/*.yaml' # Only trigger if YAML files change (more specific than 'any push')
    exclude:
      branches:
        - main # Exclude the main branch for self-triggered pushes if needed
    
    # This is the most effective for bot commits:
    # We will modify the workflow to push as 'github-actions[bot]' and then exclude that actor.
    # Note: 'exclude' on 'push' event requires more complex logic or a separate workflow.
    # The best practice is to include '[skip ci]' in the commit message.
